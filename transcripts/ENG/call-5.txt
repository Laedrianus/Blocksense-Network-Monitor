00:00:01 - 00:00:31  
I'm really happy to be joined today by Stella from the marketing side. Jacq, she is an ex Polygon community expert. It's helping us to build a better, more beautiful community, so giving us ideas how to do it in a better way. I'm really happy for this to come and share some ideas and vision about what really a community is, based on her perspective, Stella sharing ideas, not ideas, but the work that we're doing and things how we progress with the brand and the rebrand to say who we are finally. Let's stop hiding. Let's name it "The pirate ship". It's starting. And yeah, we also have activities to view things that we said we would plan, but we want to make it in the best possible way. So there's no meaning to rush it.  

00:00:34 - 00:01:02  
But the work that we're doing and things how we progress with the brand and the rebrand to say who we are finally. And they're becoming very soon. That's pretty much the overview, but let's go step by step. I mean, one of the things that were requested on the pirate calls and based on the activities of all of you was to give more freedom to local channels and we had listened. Now local channels can start organizing events with the people that expressed explicitly their desire to do so.  

00:01:07 - 00:01:36  
And I'll be happy to start seeing some game nights some AMAs, whatever you guys want to host. We spoke about this during the pirate call and I'm looking forward to see what beautiful things are going to create for those communities and also allow them to grow to have more fun. We have active Russian, Ukrainian, also Vietnamese communities. So Rahil did some good job cleaning, tidying the discord in this regard, removing some inactive channels, but we give the opportunity to new joiners to select the preference of their channel and to whenever we get, 100 people asking to create a channel we'll do it. So if you're from a country that you don't see your channel, just go there, click your flag and as soon as we get 100 people, if you're impatient, just invite your friends.  

00:02:15 - 00:02:44  
So this is going to speed up the process. Ah, yeah. So we try to have more nice and tidy Discord place where we can hang out. And one of the things that also helped with this is we want you guys to have fun in the server and there's a new idea that actually came from Gogo. It's about a trading channel and sharing ideas. So this crowd wisdom. We should really use it.  

00:03:17 - 00:03:46  
I see some people hanging around. They are already giving great advice. I think I should start educating myself also. I see your charts. I also love charts, but I love very simple charts. This is what over 10 years of trying to trade told me. Simple is the best. So yeah, this is what it is. And besides what else do we have? beside those local channels that were improved, people promoted where give you more rights to do. And the channel for trading. Let me see. Yeah, that's I think that's pretty much it. But we've taken into consideration the feedback also. And we are working on something that is going to improve the activity and also reward the activity on the channel, which is called.ah, I just read a message and got distracted.  

00:04:27 - 00:04:55  
My Discord is completely all the time receiving messages. So I think you know I know what it is. Yeah, let me let me go back to go back to my my notes. OK. Then I what I see is the emoji contest. Should be finishing now. So we're going to evaluate it. I was speaking about the points, guys. That's the point. So. The points that are going to reward the people for activity on the server.  

00:05:03 - 00:05:30  
And we're working on this and Rahil will say. Sooner or later, like I hope sooner we're gonna implement it. And additionally, we have planned activities for the coming weeks for the start of this new month. They're also going to help us grow the community. And one of those is the invite ladder. Some of you may remember we had a very successful one, the first edition. And many people joined with their friends. Some did not manage to climb the ladder, but don't worry. Now you can continue.  

00:05:33 - 00:06:02  
It means that this effort will continue from where it left. So if you need two people more to invite to get the role, you're so close to the goal. So you should just go there and do it. And for the others, they also get the chance to get some of the lower roles that we'll introduce.  

00:06:04 - 00:06:32  
We have spoken about those during the last campaign, but we did not introduce them. Now everyone that has participated actually will get their role. And I'm happy we waited because those roles will be more in the direction of the rebrand that we have. We call ourselves pirates. So we go there in this direction and the new roles, the roles that are from the pirate world, I'd say.  

00:06:34 - 00:07:02  
And what else did we get? Yeah, I already mentioned those. I also mentioned the rebrand. So I will invite Stella. It's much more fun when we're more people talking to share a little bit more about the rebrand. What's the idea? What's what we've done and what we want to see now, Stella, please.  

00:07:07 - 00:07:27  
Well, what's the idea behind behind the rebrand? It's a very basic one. When Blocksense was started, we had an idea of what we wanted to achieve and where we wanted to go with the product and everything with the brand that we wanted to do. And then a bunch of things happened. We met cool people. We managed to be a part of a a16z, their cohort. And we went to through a bunch of changes. We got a bunch of advice and that obviously reflects.  

00:07:28 - 00:07:52  
So now what we want to do, we found our identity in the pirates. We feel very strongly about that. So Arrr! is correct, I would say. And because of that, we want to reflect that in how the brand is looking at the moment. So what would that mean? It would mean new logos, new colors, new emojis, new stickers, new visuals, new everything that you're going to see very, very soon. And this emoji contest kind of gave you an idea. And I also think that our Christmas card contest also kind of gave you an idea of what to expect and where we're going with the brand. I think there's still a few surprises you will see in terms of colors and what else we've come up with.  

00:07:53 - 00:08:15  
But it should be with us pretty, pretty soon. And I can't wait to hear all the feedback that we're going to get, which is I'm hoping very strongly is going to be positive. And you're going to embrace the new brand and the new logo and everything else that comes along with it very closely to heart as you've done so far with the brand.  

00:08:16 - 00:08:40  
So yeah, the reason we did it in the first place is because, again, what we have right now, it's great. And it's obviously working for us.  

00:08:42 - 00:09:08  
Going on for us to be more relevant and even closer to the community and to enlarge it and to build a bigger and better one, a new brand is very much needed.  

00:09:12 - 00:09:42  
Also, the idea about the pirates in general, the pirates are, I mean, they have some negative connotation in the space, but I like how they introduced some really positive things in our world. I don't know if you know guys, but the pirates introduced the idea about the pension and the retirement. Also, they are kind of egalitarian. They care about the people. If you joined them, you became a pirate. So everyone who is willing to join becomes a pirate.  

00:09:45 - 00:10:17  
And this is our vision also. We will all eventually become pirates. And in the web, the pirating thing is seen and hacking is seen like also something negative, but it's actually allowing things to, yeah, finding ways to make things work sometimes cheaper, sometimes for free. But essentially, it's breaking the status quo, right? Those guys, they were having different visions and they are free souls, sitting around and even setting people free from what they're doing. They have much respect for each other and great support. There is the hierarchy that is helping for this and we are building this in our server also and I'm happy to see it implemented finally.  

00:10:19 - 00:10:49  
And it's so much easier now for everyone that is writing content to identify with this. Soon our mascot will go out, maybe Stella can share something more about it. You're giving away all my secrets and like everything that I'm keeping very closely under wraps. But yeah, there will be a mascot. There will be a bunch of things.  

00:10:52 - 00:11:19  
I don't want to reveal all of them because I do want them to be a surprise. But the mascot will be pirate related because at this stage, I'm the only one that has seen it. I find it pretty, pretty cool. I mean, if I was to design a mascot, I will do that one. So let's see what you guys think once it's public.  

00:11:21 - 00:11:55  
And the whole take, this mascot is just going to help us as I mentioned to distribute this content, but also for all of us to feel a part of the journey. And Jacq is here with us and she knows the importance of community. I invite her to share a little bit more of her experience. Hey, guys, thanks for having me on. I've been silently kind of watching for a couple of months, but this is the first time I'm up on stage speaking. So like Hristo mentioned, I come from Polygon and I was the director of community at Polygon, which was a really amazing experience, especially in crypto. You know, you don't really get to manage communities on that size very often.  

00:12:21 - 00:12:48  
And before that, I worked in gaming communities and helped build gaming communities. And also I have an IRL community that I built from 30 people to about 500 people that meet every month for a concert in the park, a free concert in the park. So that's really fun and a little bit more about my community building background.  

00:12:48 - 00:13:16  
But I I'm so excited about, the first thing when I came to help out Blocksense. The first thing I asked was like, have you thought about a mascot? And it's funny that now that we're talking about this mascot because it's here because I had already thought about it. But I was still kind of in the works, still kind of doing its thing, but I really love the story of this community. I really love the story of being a pirate because, you know, I don't know if everybody knows why it came to be, but of course like there's the Link marines and they're very like, I feel like they represent the status quo because that's like main oracle out there used and they're a little bit kind of the established player. That's why I love the Pirates because it's not only just like, like you mentioned, like very egalitarian and everyone who joins is equal and they have pensions and if you get, if you lose your leg, they pay for that, like you get extra gold for that.  

00:13:42 - 00:14:11  
Like things like this, I really love the idea of the pirate community, just really taking care of themselves and living by their own rules. So I really feel this way with Blocksense where you are living or like coming together for this singular vision and by any means necessary to bring more people in and get them excited and move forward.  

00:14:12 - 00:14:41  
And so I'm really excited to see the future of this, especially as the rebrand comes out and we start to get a little bit closer to mainnet and all of these things. So I'm really excited for that to start to come and happen and kind of build momentum and it's up to all of the pirates to kind of take that momentum and keep on sailing forward.  

00:14:41 - 00:15:15  
So I'm really excited to see the progress of this and really excited for some of these programs that will start to get built out and start to have a little bit more involvement for all the community to enjoy. So thank you so much for having me and it's, you'll probably see me lurking around from here on out.  

00:15:16 - 00:15:47  
Great. Thank you, Jacq. It's really when I think it's the, the this brand and the mascot and everything that goes around the pirates is what represents Blocksense at its core the best possible way because we want to make this technology permissionless. It means everyone will be able to finally do whatever they have in their mind and ideas that could not be possible before just because you need someone to allow you, like this current heavy system, and you need to go on back for this to happen. And technology is not about this and building permissionless technologies, decentralized technologies is all about empowering people. So I'm really happy how this is going and to support the development of the product.  

00:15:47 - 00:16:22  
What we're doing is we ask you guys to share the news about what we are building, but also we don't just sit and wait for some miracle to happen. Our team is extremely, as you know, involved in all kind of events and conference going around the world. For this coming month, it's a very busy month already. There are four events that are coming and we will start with EthOxford.  

00:16:23 - 00:17:00  
We make very good connections with the people there because we already participated in some events around them and our people from our team will be joining there. They're not here with us, but next time when we're speaking, they're going to give us details of what happened there and what kind of people they met. So EthOxford is just one of the events we're starting and then the team, the BD team is going to Consensus. Most of you know, it's really huge event. And we also have a. I wrote something that is not true on my list. I don't know where it comes from. We also going to ETHDenver, maybe I'm missing an event. Gogo is with us.  

00:17:00 - 00:17:32  
Gogo do you wanna because you you are the one going to all the events? Am I missing something? The main things are Consensus, Denver later on, like some of the Token events and the one in Singapore. Yeah. Yeah. OK, I missed this one. I think I coppy pasted something wrong here from my list, but basically, yes… You're missing two events, actually, we're going to be part of a panel at EthOxford, which will be really cool.  

00:17:37 - 00:18:09  
And then we are also going to have our very own meetup in Bulgaria that's going to be dedicated to us. And the founders will be there of Blocksense and they're going to cover everything that's going to happen from now on. They're going to talk about the roadmap and the plans and all that. So it's going to be really, really cool. It's going to be on the 26th of February.  

00:18:32 - 00:19:04  
So a lot of events right now happening. We're going to be all over the place outside of the main ones. It's true from Hong Kong to Denver. Sofia, of course, is the world capital of crypto, we really talented teams there. And actually, I know I get confused because I wrote Sofia Crypto Meetup. And this is I think one of the oldest meetups in the space in general. I know the organizer personally and they were also the organizers of ETHSofia.  

00:19:05 - 00:19:32  
And when I was looking, I was looking at my list and Sofia Crypto, I got confused with EthSofia and Sofia Crypto. But thanks Stella for clarifying this for the people here. And of course, you guys know those are the very big events like EthDenver, Consensus and as Georgi mentioned, Token also in Singapore.  

00:19:34 - 00:20:05  
International (Devcon), but it's not going to happen this year. It's every two years so, we start the year very strongly also coming, our product, first product coming next month. So all this work is finally going to be revealed meeting awesome partners, building new relationships.  

00:20:05 - 00:20:31  
And I can ask Georgi if he has some of the updates related to BD and what other things we're doing. If there's something we can share at this stage. We have mentioned many partnerships, but we're still working. They're not finalized. Some people from the community did a great job also reaching out directly to projects. Thnak you so much for this to propose events and can do together.  

00:20:31 - 00:21:05  
But yeah, let's make it the official way, follow the steps. we announce those partnerships and we go those teams. This can be more exciting. Actually, finally, things are getting real.  

00:21:07 - 00:21:43  
And we are deployed on a bunch of new testnets. And we're working towards deploying on like kind of mainnet for those chains like World, Injective, Status, Lumia Basically, we've come through all the existing chains that are coming up. All the EVM chains that are coming up and have been reaching out to them. And honestly, it's yeah, I think there might be a few that we've missed, but I think we've covered like 90% of them. And yeah, we've deployed on most of these most of their testnets.  

00:21:44 - 00:22:22  
Application builders, we have a couple of really interesting application builders on Base specifically like this prediction market for AI agents / prediction market and this landing protocol, which is we're building a depeg aware lending market where you would not have the scenario that happened to Morpho a few a few weeks ago. Where the market got drained because of basically a bad oracle configuration.  

00:22:23 - 00:22:54  
So yeah, we can hope we'll be pushing this out maybe in the next few weeks, the next two, three weeks. And starting to push a bunch of marketing around them, hopefully, and that will be a big win basically for Base. And then for us on Base. So that's that's kind of the most interesting in terms of applications.  

00:22:55 - 00:23:37  
And then we also have this tooling this tooling kind of side of the business where basically we have a fork of Noir. Which is the Aztec's ZK language. We're doing improvements on Noir and We have one of the features that we added to one of the features is kind of different different Different backend for the compilation targets instead of using Plonky we added Plonky2 as well and we get other proof systems. Anyway, the point is that there's a product team that's trying to use it at this point. Our fork. So that's cool. And we're working on a couple of potential deals where we can get paid to develop some additional tooling stuff but in general, we're going to push this we're going to start pushing the work that we've been doing, this kind of big brain work. Like Actually, right now the engineering is writing kind of their Like a written piece and a demo, video demo and kind of educational series about this zk and programming languages stuff that we've been doing so we'll push that out also in the next few weeks that that'll be cool.  

00:24:03 - 00:24:35  
Yeah, so that's kind of the BD side. Actually, I'm hoping you guys have been enjoying like all these contests. I think especially these kind of Joker Race contest we managed to accrue some of the fees and actually a good amount so we'll be using that budget for like events and for the local events or just other community site community based stuff so it's actually what I'm seeing is that we could do a bunch of Joker Race contests if we managed to get like 10 11 and then or just use the fees back as rewards or just use it as a budget for the community so yeah anyway.  

00:25:13 - 00:25:45  
We'll think about that. And then and then either give out the fees back as rewards or just use the budget for the community so yeah anyway.  

00:25:45 - 00:26:21  
And then the final thing I kind of wanted to mention is we do want to lead with basically the whole team right the whole team to be we want to be showing off the whole team all the time. You have you guys know Martin right he's been kind of.  

00:26:21 - 00:26:58  
Becoming a Twitter influencer, Magnus is been like Going to a bunch of conferences and Speaking with like really smart people on panels. And obviously the founders myself and Zahary and and now soon we'll start showing off more of Stella and our head writer as well. So my point is, I do want you guys to really try to engage with with the team. We have the team list on Twitter like quote, comment, retweet, likes just help the algorithm and boost us Because, yeah, that will help tremendously and If we become KOLs it will obviously help so, like I've told you many times.  

00:26:58 - 00:27:39  
It will be awesome help if you become KOLs because yeah, I mean, we are community. So obviously we have Rahil for example, who has some interesting tactics around like the kaito yapper stuff we can. And Martin also has some interesting tactics. We can kind of like train you on that. Really, you can ask us for anything. We can help out. We can leverage our connections to smart folks to the investors or whatever. To other KOLs and we can help you guys out.  

00:27:39 - 00:28:17  
And then we'll promote you back. I mean, It's a Yeah, that's why we're community. Yeah, this is something that is really this Something that's really important and we started this there is already an initiative. There's the list of the team that has been shared and you can support this content as Georgi mentioned, but also there's a list of all the members of the crew here.  

00:28:18 - 00:28:46  
All the people that are contributing and they're in the Oracle Pirates. We have this special dedicated account.  

00:28:48 - 00:29:14  
Now I got a little bit confused because on on the pirate calls we speak about those things but not everyone of you is here. So I feel like maybe I'm repeating myself but some people don't know this information and this comes from suggestions from the people from the community. Feel free to to get your way to the To those calls also being pirate. You know what it means the most active people the biggest contributors and for example this month. I see Smith with us. He's creating a lot of content and I wanna communicate that he's getting the pirate role.  

00:29:14 - 00:29:46  
There is space for more people to join. So follow the example of those that get the role.  

00:29:46 - 00:30:14  
You get the latest news. We get to discuss things together. We have two times a month and not calls but chats now because it's more convenient for most of you. This will be figure out works the best and Then then you get to know the things and be part of the vibe but being active following the accounts and supporting each other is what Georgi mentioned is going to help every one of us like  

00:30:14 - 00:30:46  
No, I have to smart phones. I just activate my account is being sleeping for many years. I don't use it. But now I say, okay, this is great opportunity because this is a time of building also personal brands.  

00:30:46 - 00:31:23  
So don't be afraid to come out share content share the things that you like and make sure to support us so the people around you and support the whole community.  

00:31:23 - 00:31:58  
So let's use the let's leverage the power of the community and it's so easy. Just follow those list go through the messages interact with those people. This is how we get to make the algorithm work for us.  

00:31:58 - 00:32:25  
We are the pirates and it's good to remember that. It's all good.  

00:32:25 - 00:33:02  
And we have the final thing that we need to do to give them the best possible. The role of the month is one per month.  

00:33:02 - 00:33:32  
Do you guys have some questions? I hear, I hear, I see the chat. It's full, but if there are questions we can answer now. This would be a great time. I'll give a little bit of time and also if some of you want to jump on stage and say something. It's also a good opportunity. Otherwise you can get a chat. I see this guy Temnik_cook. He's amazing. There's no role that I can give him now. I need to make a special role for Temnik_cook. Seriously, he's everywhere posting really nice content all the time. Improving the quality of it. Thank you, brother. He's having the last comment so easy, but it jumps into your eyes. I'm also really excited to see the emoji contest, to evaluate it and to see you guys start using the emojis. Now I see that there are some on actually Jacq shared something really cool. I want you to. You qualify for the emoji contest.  

00:34:02 - 00:34:37  
If you would have applied, maybe for the next one because the server is much more fun with more emojis, right? Okay. Are there any questions? Everything is clear. Did we set the picture for what is coming? I mean, last time we spoke about what's coming for the year in general where we want to go. Now we now we're saying. What is ahead for the next month is really exciting month. I allow myself to repeat.  

00:34:38 - 00:35:08  
Few of the things on the community side we will have exciting programs like the ladder campaign finally reached. I am the one that is dragging it little bit because we wanted to have good cover of the campaign. Good KOLs to support it and that's that's the reason we're working on on it and also to make it as fair as possible and you so you guys get the roles that you deserve.  

00:35:08 - 00:35:46  
Also, if you invite few people you still get a role you're on board and this is really cool. Lets live by the pirate's rules. I mean, be fair. That's very important. I'd say, I see Temnik is. Everyone is asking what are the news? Yeah. I mean, those are the news.  

00:35:46 - 00:36:26  
Besides the things we are doing to improve the server. The activity on the tech side. People are getting ready for the first product to be released the BD working super hard to make more connections.  

00:36:26 - 00:37:02  
So the world can get to know us and projects can get start to use our products. This is pretty cool and the marketing doing this amazing work of helping us find the direction and the identity that we are so ready to embrace. I'm actually for the first time so happy to wear black and white. It feels so so piratish. It means that we unconsciously choose the colors of the brand even before we set the clear direction.  

00:37:03 - 00:37:35  
I'm very much looking forward to see the Russian community events to start and all the local events and as we mentioned before from those online events we want to move to in person events and as Georgi mentioned we have budget for this. We want to support you in doing those events and I'll be very happy we we get there and next month we start, maybe it's really about why not if the community grow so much.  

00:37:35 - 00:38:03  
We start making plans about in person events and other things like this. On my side I have no much to add if somebody want to add something. Yes, Smith, I'm also looking forward to everything that is coming next month and this year in general. So it's a little bit hard to lead the conversation to follow the chat. If somebody wants to step in and say hello, goodbye, anything that you have in your mind.  

00:38:05 - 00:38:36  
If there's something that you want to express now is the moment. Then now it's time for a request from me. You mentioned a Russian community, which is great because here's what I want to ask. Where do you guys, can you recommend a local podcast or YouTube channel or whatever it is where you would like Blocksense to be featured. Anything that you listen on a daily weekly, biweekly, monthly basis that you find really interesting really relevant that you've learned a lot about the space from.  

00:38:36 - 00:39:01  
And I think that would be a good fit. I don't know if you can recommend any places where I should go and talk to people for us to be featured that'd be amazing. You'll be my MVPs.  

00:39:02 - 00:39:39  
It is a very special role. This is also the power of the community and leverage knowledge. I mean, we can do a lot of research and we spend many hours on working on things, but the intelligence of the community is great. And each one of you is in the space.  

00:39:39 - 00:40:05  
So I'm open to visiting because the whole goal is for us to spread the word. What better way to do it than also using a native language and we can definitely do that.  

00:40:05 - 00:40:30  
And I for sure am missing a lot of places that are out there. And if you can help me find them, that'd be really amazing.

Thank you so much, guys. Thanks for joining. I see so familiar faces like every time supporting us every time with us trying to get the latest news Versus777 his here, facts parade Those are people that are very much engaged in the community.  

00:41:03 - 00:41:28  
I mentioned Temnik_cook. What will do without Rahil? Come on. I think he mentioned he could not join. He's just playing games with us. He's saying no, I'm busy. I can't come and here he is. He was the embodiment of the community manager. He actually really loves being around the people being so nice and helpful. Thank you.  

00:41:28 - 00:41:54  
I think that would be a good fit. I don't know if you can recommend any places where I should go and talk to people for us to be featured that'd be amazing.  

00:41:54 - 00:42:28  
And I for sure am missing a lot of places that are out there. And if you can help me find them, that'd be really amazing.  

00:42:28 - 00:43:00  
We are all looking forward to the next steps and to building.  

00:43:01 - 00:43:28  
And I am very excited to see the future.  

00:43:30 - 00:43:58  
And I have a little bit confused.  

00:44:00 - 00:44:30  
I want to share more.  

00:44:31 - 00:44:58  
And I hope you guys will continue to do the same.  

00:45:02 - 00:45:29  
Thank you.
