00:00:00 - 00:01:24
Let's just get started. We should give me a second, keep losing my my not technical guy is asking if you would like to start your camera, it's up to you. Oh yeah, hold on. Yeah, I do that. Well, while Google is preparing, I mean some of you might not know him. I'm CST Community lead, so maybe maybe you know me, they're new guys, so I'm happy we greet you here, welcome guys, family is growing, have nice partnership and Community is growing, but for those of you that might not know, gii he's

00:00:42 - 00:01:58
one of the co-founders and the guy that I work the most from the very beginning. It's a big wrestler you could say that what we achieve here is based on a lot of his hard work coming from the Manta mentality with Manta never stops. It seems like G never stops as well. I personally speak with him in every possible hour of the day so he's always active and yeah today he joined to to to speak what we have done this year and what we're looking for to achieve next year very

00:01:20 - 00:02:40
important updates I think and also overview of what we have achieved so far so getting the direction and yeah the Milestones let's go. It's going to be a short call. The moment we're done you can go go and have with the questions but we don't we know it's like in between holidays. Yeah good you're here and yeah we can take yeah we can take as much time as it needs but yeah anyway I was reflecting on the last last year actually we did we did a lot of stuff you know it's been it's been it's been pretty pretty pretty hectic and pretty been pretty interesting the whole year. I mean we started l s towards like the end of 2023 and I think the first kind of major place that we went to and then we got some kind of our initial investor commitments was at the def connected disto at the end of 2023 and since then you know it's it's been it's been it's been pretty interesting. I'll just go like I guess like kind of one by one of of stuff for one thing I mean first

00:02:42 - 00:03:54
thing that we did was kind of on board like 10 Engineers from one of our previous projects and then over time kind of hire 10 more you know we have now we have a ZK team a front end team a backend team a tooling team and and you know we even have this new we like we took some time but we build a a BD and a marketing kind of arm which you know the company didn't really have at all because I mean a lot of these Engineers they worked in the past together but anyway over time we built this kind of

00:03:18 - 00:04:44
team of 10 marketing and BD team and you've seen Magnus you've seen Martin and you seen a lot of our community folks and marketing folks so that's kind of on the on the people side we went from 10 to roughly 30 which is pretty crazy you know we finan this with our kind of seed seed race seed round which you know we got participation with some really cool some really cool funds like the a16z crypto CSX which is the accelerator program of of a6c crypto and we got like public public goods

00:04:00 - 00:05:27
and like ta adventures and a bunch of like really cool Angels like VC Builder and and some really good advisers like folks from from like Kenny from Manta for example and that kind of kicked us off and yeah like I mentioned we went through the a6z crypto accelerator and we even we even got around U you know our seed round was 4 million but we also got around like pretty good trunk of cash and grants and and different kind of incentives from our partners so

00:04:44 - 00:06:05
we're very strong on we're very well funded at the moment and we're doing really well and that that kind of some of the major stuff and that brings us to today I guess I'll before like I move on from these points and into the product I guess do you guys have any and I can stop and like maybe questions or or comments if something's not making sense and then I'll tell you guys a lot we B about the products and yeah well basically guys can go with the

00:05:25 - 00:06:34
questions in the chat or leave the questions for the last part so it's it's more convenient I'll just ask you to slowly move the lid of your laptop so we can this is what the technical guys say you you have to know guys we have a technical guy in the background always taking care the sound is good the quality of the recording is good so we have we have we have those we have those C recorded for those of you that will miss it can go back and see it's a great source of information for

00:05:59 - 00:07:00
what what we're doing right I guess to summarize really quickly these points like we we got this funding and then we built a really good team like of almost 30 people engineers and bedian marketing and we got some good grants and some good aird drops for for the company with from our partners and now we're really ready to take on 2025 and and we're go to market basically with what we've built and I'll tell yeah and I'll tell you about the products yeah we we can we can

00:06:31 - 00:07:55
definitely I move on yeah anyway so the product that's pretty it's been yeah the products so now we have one that is pretty much almost ready for to to go into production this kind of interface for def for def for new defi ecosystems to basically support anything that chain link or Redstone or or like even guys like P can can support and provide we can provide to brand new chains that are coming up and and this this is something that that that's been that's pretty much ready we have

00:07:13 - 00:08:25
a couple of I think three chains that they're pretty much ready to even go into to main net and around like 18 in test net major majority of all of them are evm chains but soon we'll have support for svm as well and and these are like some of the some of the the chains in the pipeline I know guys like morph baras Trea know atte monut like really good really good chains and we have so much more in the pipeline and then we're like working with the best kind of PLS like the U arbitrum and

00:07:49 - 00:09:07
the zings and the op stacks and so forth so this this product that is kind of helping new chains set up a defi ecosystem and where we can be the first Oracle provider that's that's pretty much ready to go and we're going to go live with it and at least two or three chains maybe end of January beginning of February something like that least like end of q1 so this product we're seeing good good traction and we'll be live soon the next Pro that we're building is this very low latency

00:08:29 - 00:09:46
you know pool Oracle or more like a PO pool Oracle basically the point here is that it's very low latency here we can either enshrine it or make it a pool Oro but we have a a very like a very high like a tier one basically layer one that would potentially like this to be enshrined into their into their protocol and we are hopefully going to win this deal and implement this next year and and I don't really want to go into details but if it happens it's going to be a huge huge win for us

00:09:06 - 00:10:18
so fingers crossed guys so that's like this this low latency product and then with the with with this first two product this is kind of the the one two punch for every new chain will need that every new chain will need and we will provide then we also took some time over the last few months to to build up this kind of AI capabilities one of them the main thing being kind of providing a verifiable inference we're well into development of it's kind of like aura or

00:09:44 - 00:10:54
ritual you can say some of our competitors but we are May in the middle of developing it hopefully we'll have it in a few months and or like two or three months because especially now that we're seeing all this hype with the like all these AI agents that are popping up it's something I mean we we we kind of bet on it when we were six months ago we thinking what what should be developed so hopefully we'll be we'll be read in a few more and we can write this wave so that's that's

00:10:18 - 00:11:29
that should be coming up very soon and yeah this is kind of the the Oracle product and on top of that we also developed some internal tooling which we for Z for zik stuff and really that's tooling that revolves around Noir the programming language from attec and this this this tooling can be leveraged by you know all kinds of other developers like ZK developers and we hope to find yeah we hope that basically that will happen and that will give us a lot of a lot of

00:10:54 - 00:12:09
popularity at the very least and a lot of appreciation from like the the best developers the best developers out there so that's yeah that's very interesting work for example like providing custom backends for the for Noir like different than plon like plony 2 or expander or whatever other proving systems or providing like formal verification capabilities or yeah or like providing like debugging tools for for the language this kind of stuff we managed to develop over the last N9 months and

00:11:30 - 00:12:42
yeah we're we'll see how the wider Community how they how they appreciate it and even on top of that the final thing that we kind of did on this product side is that we developed two really strong Partnerships with the like with ecosystem Pro want to use us as a as a as a Oro in their system one being this llm router and then the other one being this kind of defi aggregator and in both of these we have a very deep relationship where if these projects do well we're betting

00:12:07 - 00:13:18
a lot on them so we have we we've put some effort and soon we will be able to like show them off maybe within the next like two or three months again so that's kind of on the product side we have the the the like the push Oracle which is for new chains which is a like a a replacement for chain link and Redstone and we have a a low latency pool Oracle which is more of a replacement for p these both of these like help new chains get off the ground running and we have a bunch of

00:12:43 - 00:13:48
deals that are in the pipeline pretty much almost ready to to to go and then on top of that we have this kind of AI and tooling lines of products that that that I getting some traction and this kind of makeshift ecosystem incubator where we're we're putting a lot of in some of the projects that they're building with block sense so yeah that's the that's on the product front yeah if you if you allow me to summarize it's like wow you you say it pretty well but not

00:13:15 - 00:14:31
to to to remove any confusion or look it's much more than Oracle and also in the Oracle space we're building different product so you could look at Bens as yeah we we developing different products that can serve in the the space and to companies from early stage protocols that don't have workouts and it's very making very easy for them to have one and also a programmable one so they can do whatever use case that they need to and that's that's a niche for sure and many of the projects we speak with and 

00:13:53 - 00:15:06
Can U correct me if I'm wrong but we spoke with more than 120 or 130 projects so far so the feedback is many of those companies they they they like this feature very much because this is what allows you to the program programable part of box is what allows you to make the use case that you you dream of and you cannot find feeds for it but also we are focus on different products and because the technology that we're developing is allowing it and we have wide range of possibilities when speaking should

00:14:30 - 00:15:49
connect block sense to something much wider than an oracle also the inference part it's very interesting think to see how it grows and how it matures in the space because it's pretty much new and so far we we would say that it needs time to for us to see how it how it matures but we are working on multiple lines to say developing different products and with different partners exploring those opportun unities so this is pretty pretty great thank you for updating the community on this yeah I mean all of these

00:15:08 - 00:16:20
products we try to really work with the the the the best like Market participants it's call them that way in those categories like like I said with the with the chains we are working with in our pipeline it's like guys like more Barra craa you know atte monad you know then for for like these kind of AI use cases we're trying to integrate our system into like the the Frameworks like AI 16z or like virtuals and for this tooling we're we're really trying to work with the like with War which is

00:15:44 - 00:16:50
like the best ZK language right there the only one right there so like all the best developers are using it and really put provide value in all of these areas so so like the best people out there are using our systems and our and our tools and and hopefully that's going to that's going to leave an like a trail right an impact and people people will talk about this more and then set us up for very very good 2025 what we are definitely building and it might seem slow in the community side

00:16:17 - 00:17:34
but we're setting the super solid foundation for a longlasting and very successful product here and project and yeah as Google mentioned on few sites I mean growing a company from five people to now 35 and maybe next round we getting 60 this is a challenge by itself and developing developing the product and figure out the market fit and all those things they are challenged by themselves so every one of those steps are very important and we put a lot of effort into exploring and making things

00:16:56 - 00:18:20
the best possible way we have super bright te of U professional X Google and I don't want to mention all the fun companies people that are in the team but definitely very very smart people that are putting their valuable lifetime even into this we're like 247 team seriously there I think BL never blon never sleeps this must be this must be the our slogan because we are available all around the world so this is also very distributed team yeah yeah the team is that'ss are I think probably the most proud we

00:17:38 - 00:19:03
we we we really got a an amazing team going you know guys like like Chris said like from like Google from like uber from like phds and and compilers and guys that have built multibillion dollar systems and U so the team crazy but anyway now the the the next thing I wanted to say to you guys is that we also did a few Partnerships that were more like okay we need certain piece of tech or something from another team and then we use it and then this kind of partnership is for

00:18:21 - 00:19:39
example we we got a very strong partnership with air like we're going to be using becoming an ABS and tapping into the economic security of of the Risk Takers that are RIS taking on N kind of like e Oracle or or whatever other ABS systems that is very crucial for for the security of our system and we prioritized it that from from day one and very happy that we managed to to to get that going and on top of that we're also building we're trying to additionally like enforce this this line of
00:19:00 - 00:20:13
thinking and and add additional like raking and the protocols like additional security from other RIS taking protocols like for example like symbiotic or or some of the other folks and we we are talking to a few of them and and hopefully 2025 we can add few more of these Partners to our roster obviously on the Z side we've talked to you know we are working closely with like teams like nebra and cindry and and the cisc and even like U guys like FMA so we're very well connected
00:19:36 - 00:20:42
and and obviously like the Noir team and so forth and one other U partnership that we've been exploring but we haven't really executed and hopefully we'll execute in 2025 is with the data availability partner either you know we've had like preliminary discussions with guys like Hive or but we we need to we need to push this along and and hopefully we'll do that fairly soon so this kind of the three main kind of tech Partnerships on the reaking side on the
00:20:09 - 00:21:44

ZK and the and data availability so two out of three for 2024 is decent and hopefully we'll we'll do the da exit in in the next six months so yeah that's in terms of like Tech part parip now we also managed to get our kind of initial set of infrastructure Partners and of our node operators and our data providers I would say 60 70% complete and set up which should be in time for main net launch our plan main net launch at kind of end of January or early February so that's that's good news

00:20:56 - 00:22:15
we got very reputable rable node operators to to be in the initial set and also like really good variety of data providers either like exchanges or market makers so we have a a good variety in that sense and yeah I mean that's in terms of the Partnerships and then the final thing I would say is kind of what we did on the marketing side and yeah but maybe if you have any questions for for these Partnerships for well sorry guys I I had some issues with my my connection here I missed a part

00:21:41 - 00:23:01
but of the conversation but as G is online I'm iy things are under control just can you can you tell me where we are oh I just went through kind of our what we the tag that we using our Partnerships and then the that we setup of our node operators and our and our initial node operators and data providers is pretty much complete as well and then and the final thing that I would touch on is the kind of what we did on the marketing side it's Pro probably I mean Christ and I have

00:22:24 - 00:23:48
been working on this for for the longest I mean we started on this this earliest I my attention split especially last 6 months I was much more focused on on our kind of the the BD in and some other operational stuff so maybe I had a little bit less of input but anyway in the beginning we really focused on he trying to set up this this little community that we have we managed to you know to to meet some great folks like like know some of you that are are here like are

00:23:06 - 00:24:22
Hill and U we tried a bunch of stuff like you know I remember trying streams some different meetups and and I guess we're still figuring it out and and I hope we will really we'll really get get much closer over 2025 I feel like I like I said started off tried to start off strong and then slacked off with the community building the last 6 months or not slack off but I was really focused on on something else but now that we hopefully win a few of these deals and deploying a few really good


00:23:43 - 00:24:58
chains and I'll be able to really put a lot more effort into community building and and yeah and hopefully make it make it better right and and we have some big stuff planned here right like really big stuff obviously you see you see stuff that are happening with with other teams so you you know you see where the winds are blowing in terms of kind of the the sentiment the market sentiment so you would yeah I me I would expect I expect big things from from from ourselves and I would you can

00:24:22 - 00:25:34
expect big things basically on the on the community side we really believe in the how say and and getting you guys involved and getting you guys really have like skin in the game and then and calling this thing your your own and and then putting your and putting your you know heart and soul into this like like we are and this is what we want and hopefully we'll get there we'll be this kind of community and culture and I think we have been trying to and yeah hopefully we will

00:24:57 - 00:26:22
get there and and then I I personally promise that I I'll spend much more time now that we have some win or hopefully we get some wins on the on the V side but anyway we we grew up to like 15 20K right with some I guess most people are not very active but the the people who are very who are active are are quite active and we have this kind of new wave of like Partnerships with different communities like like Mon and Van and this is hopefully we'll continue we'll continue exploring

00:25:40 - 00:26:52
those and and like bringing in more people from all sorts of different places and yeah one big thing was the eat sopia that was a an event that we planned for for a few months and we helped or organize and bring in a lot of the the sponsors and the teams and it the whole team got involved and it it turned out very well I think we learned a lot as a team it was kind of the first major test for for the team how how we're going to execute whether we can get a test net out whether we can get an

00:26:16 - 00:27:32
MVP out whether some people can actually use it whether we can provide them technical support and help them integrate and you know like end to end actually have something working and it it did work out right so we were very happy and after that we also executed a few other pons you know with in cold club with Oxford blockchain society and a few other kind of project Partners so I mean yeah the tactic was mixed results but I think it off especially was was very good and we yeah anyway the now we're

00:26:53 - 00:28:06
also doing a big Rebrand I mean not a Rebrand but we're kind of finding the visual identity of the the project we we had left it at the back burner for a while and now we have it now now now it's I think it's almost complete and we Al like we reveal it within a month I think and oh yeah and the another thing was we really especially in the last six months the last three months we tried to ramp up kind of the public speaking and we've been speaking a few events a few
00:27:30 - 00:28:34

podcasts especially like zakari and then especially like guys like Martin have been Super Active on Twitter and I think hopefully that will like put like that that would help us know people start talking about us but anyway that's we are putting a lot of effort into it personally I've started also posting a lot on on Twitter and hopefully you know guys like Stan and then beo have also been posting a lot and and just more public speaking more Twitter and then the whole team become kind of sing

00:28:02 - 00:29:17
KS and and we help you guys also become sing KS and that that PST the whole P the whole project and I think we will put a lot of effort into this over the next year as well so that's on the marketing right we got started we started up we really tried to focus on on especially the like the good good like core contributors of the community we executed in a bunch of hackaton and it s was especially good we're almost done with the with the new look and kind of the new visual identity

00:28:40 - 00:30:01
and we did a bunch of events and public speaking especially in the last three month so and that should be how we yeah I mean that's that's what happened 2024 I guess to go over 2025 it will take another 30 minutes maybe but what the main thing what should be the main thing to expect I would say deployments on these really good chains that I was mentioning earlier deployments at least well at least one deployment for each product right on a very good chain and putting our

00:29:21 - 00:30:48
tools into the hands of the best developers and having svm ready having our ABS ready having more kind of Tech Partnerships especially the da and then over time slowly expanding our initial set of operators and data providers and just doing just going harder on the marketing especially like Community and community building and I think we want to provide the more localized kind of events and budgets and yeah just that's the idea there was a question there was a question to this the

00:30:03 - 00:31:14
ambassador program and how it's going I mean this everything that g described is like a laying Foundation of what we're going to do on the community side also on the marketing we believe we are a team I would say people that believe that you need to have something to brag about speak about and and this something should be something really good so that's why all the focus went into developing and also developing strong relationship ecosystem Partners developing the product itself and we had

00:30:39 - 00:32:01
to of course Focus also on the community but expanding the community and we we'll definitely go with this the moment the community grows and to a certain point which we are reaching now I think 20 20K is a very healthy level Community then we can start speaking and activating this local members and starting with u local events also the ambassador program on itself it's been cooking since very long time I'll say maybe eight nine months but it didn't it didn't come out because we didn't see

00:31:20 - 00:32:32
the community to be ready I personally want like three times more people to join those calls and I want to know why those people don't join the calls if there's something you can improve many of you participate in the feedback questioner that we sent out and it was great to to see this now we are building this together and it's very important for us to hear back from us from you also so regarding the amb program just just stay tuned but it's definitely coming the I I would say maybe end of

00:31:55 - 00:33:09
QA with Q q1 next year we'll we'll have something going on already on on local levels especially where especi with virtual events or directly with iners events this those are things that we need to to figure out and I said that the community needs to grow and I already see 30 people joining from great yeah I mean guys guys you can we I we should have formalized that and we promis that they will formalize the ambassador program so you know exactly like but in general I'll tell

00:32:35 - 00:33:49
like one thing that we would want that I really want to happen is for to find Regional like actually in different like regions people who can organize get together on a little event or a little hack and then execute on that and kind of build very localized communities this is something that we would in incentivized heavily and the yeah we're prepared to like really help like really push and then the other thing that I really we really need is if you guys kind of essentially just go

00:33:12 - 00:34:26
into the different communities of like new chains or of protocols and figure out if they need something like an Oracle and let us know then if if you find if you hear about new protocols or new chains com up that that need an oracle just let let us know and that's super helpful that would also be heavily incentivized if you if you find us if essentially find us leads I think this is the two most important things we'll also do some educational stuff where we'll we'll figure out how you can

00:33:49 - 00:34:58
also just do just just talk about the product right and talk about us like let's say on Twitter and then that can also be incentivized but just easy things is finest leads of chains and protocols to users like that would be amazing and yeah yeah the these things if you can if you can do that for us it it will be much more it will be worth much more than any ambassador program because essentially what we want is when we have a problem when we have a need we want to be able to one of the first places we go

00:34:23 - 00:35:35
for for help is you guys right because our community maybe you can get help out with this for and right now our main main need is to get more chains find more chains that are early on that don't that where we can deploy our Oracle and be kind of the one of the main Oracle providers and and win some business this way this is our biggest need and then and then then finding like good developers to use us right either protocol Builders or you just just good developers to use are like ZK tooling

00:34:59 - 00:36:21
so help us out with that and I guess I'll take some time to also like list out all maybe some some some immediate or not so immediate needs that maybe you can help us out and you help us out and we we'll we'll incentivize it yeah on the site of the user generated content or pieces that go there are few people that are very active they've been always recognized and incentivized by the roles that we giving and laa Ro which actually means CH in Chinese language it means teacher so you're ping information out

00:35:40 - 00:36:51
for BL sense and the most active people in the community are getting this role and this month we have a promotion of one person which is just very good example of how things can go because he just joined our community recently and now this month is getting promoted I need to just find his name I I will shout it out later but yeah he's one of the very good examples and the other one is I see even in the chat is versus and because of his activity constant activity we decide to promote

00:36:15 - 00:37:37
him to a pirate because Pirates are the crew that is really how to say like Die Hard blocks and Ste we are those are the people that are all the time active that are all the time helping others to figure out things and essentially this is what we want to grow this core Community into a bigger community of people to help the others coming we have the V now they're really cool guys I like the whole team everyone working with them was amazing just the communications so I like to see

00:36:56 - 00:38:12
things in this level so yeah continue with this kind of contributions you you get the rewards on on the side of the content we will try to make things clearer as what kind of content but as G said there are also immediate priorities if you find leads if you think that some project is suitable for us just DM me or you're right in the also we have the section where you say partnership propos you can open a ticket in this court I'm looking at those ra also is looking at those and we are sourcing everything to the

00:37:37 - 00:38:51
founding team where they see which opportunities are good for us at the moment and how to engage with those the team is working really hard to make sure they look at all the all the potential partners and to see what are the entries we have there based on the product that we mentioned earlier that we're developing so and your work you should know it's always always seen and appreciated so just keep on the the good more guys yeah I mean we're about to ship 20 so 2025 going hopefully I mean it's going

00:38:17 - 00:39:49
to go it should go it should it should really accelerate very quickly we ship the end of January or beginning of February we have deployed on multiple chains then we roll out the next product next product and soon after that we'll have a prob soon after that we should have some kind of TG and yeah hopefully everything everything unravels next year like 2025 like 2025 seems to be the year of block sense right I mean all this prepar yeah very well set up yeah yeah we're working for this the

00:39:05 - 00:40:12
support we got from all the investors the cool partnership that we're developing at the moment the very important documentation release and what G said also we have start testing and trying those in hackaton people start developing use case using box that were not possible before could go on the blog and read some of the Articles like AG Shield or insurance is insurance for agriculture or also flight tickets Insurance things that they they don't need intermediaries anyways and it can be implemented

00:39:39 - 00:40:48
with box in a very easy and efficient way so those are the the things we are building and now the of course we are now deployed on 18 test Nets which means we already in a working relationship with those test Nets and exploring the opportunities there and all the projects that they're building on them and the cool news that mentioned the big things coming and happening in 25 is will very soon start deploying on their main Nets which means we're absolutely ready to go with V1 production right because the

00:40:13 - 00:41:30
next step of our production will be to get completely decentralized and to have our own set of permissionless validator right so everyone will be able to be a validator but at the beginning we'll start the permission like lug notes or blon or yeah exactly yeah I mean over especially probably towards the second part of the Year 2025 we'll we'll really try hard to like to to decentralize the system more validators more data providers like make it permissionless make the the the script

00:40:51 - 00:42:11
the the Oracle deployment permission is and then that's where we also deploy the ZK machinery and then we also do the TG at that point once we have the once we have roll out to for like the system decentralized yeah we have very ambitious plan but it's it's being rolled out step by step and that's how being we're testing and proving that things work and at least yeah we have the MVP now we'll we'll ship it and then we'll ship a few other products over the next

00:41:32 - 00:42:52
six months then we'll decentralize the system the ZK machiner and we we'll have the token and that should that should be 2025 2025 sounds like a very exciting year for us guys so I'm happy our community is growing also this is the i' say the first time we have around 35 people tuning in thank you everyone it's a great to see this and I always look at things this way now we're 35 and tomorrow we're 335 know I just know that we we're going to reach on more people and yeah our product will will
